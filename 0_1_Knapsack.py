# What is the base case for the recursive knapsack algorithm?
# The base case occurs when there are no items (n == 0) or the knapsack's weight capacity is zero (W == 0), where the result is 0.

# What is memoization, and why is it used here?
# Memoization is the process of storing the results of subproblems in a table (t) to avoid redundant calculations. It helps optimize the algorithm by ensuring each subproblem is solved only once.

# How does the algorithm decide whether to include or exclude an item?
# If the item's weight is less than or equal to the knapsackâ€™s remaining capacity, the algorithm makes two recursive calls: one for including the item and one for excluding it, and chooses the maximum value from these two choices.

# What is the time complexity of this solution?
# The time complexity is O(n * W), where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of the knapsack.

# Can you explain the role of the t[n][W] table?
# The table t[n][W] stores the maximum value that can be achieved with the first n items and a knapsack of capacity W. It is used for memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.

# What happens if the weight of an item is greater than the remaining capacity of the knapsack?
# If an item's weight exceeds the remaining capacity of the knapsack, it cannot be included in the solution. The algorithm will recursively solve the problem without that item
